		<h3>Research Goals</h3>	
		openHTML is a web editor designed to help beginners
		eventually transition to more sophisticated tools. We want to expose beginners to code
		and scaï¬€old their coding activity, while reducing other barriers to building web pages
		and publishing them online. We are taking an iterative, learner-centered
		approach and have evaluated the initial design of
		openHTML with a lab-based task study.
